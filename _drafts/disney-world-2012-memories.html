<p>Saturday, January 14</p>
<p>Up early to get to the airport for our 10:00 am flight. We decided to only check one bag, due to airline fees, but that left a lot of bags to carry on to the plane. While it was stressful, we made it through security and onto the plane without much trouble. Alyssa sat between Ryan and Andrea, and Jeremy and I sat across the aisle from each other one row in front. After our flight, we went to the Disney's Magical Express bus to the Pop Century resort. We checked in at the enormous front desk and were assigned room 8327, in the "90's" Building, adorned with CDs and bulky cell phones. We dumped our bags in the room and headed straight to the bus stand for EPCOT. It was a good thing we bought sweatshirts &amp; jackets as the temperatures were in the 50s and dropping as the sun went down. We were pretty hungry for dinner by that point, but we decided to quickly take a ride on Spaceship: Earth. We had subscribed to a special App on my iPhone that gave us updated line times and it told us it was a short wait. After the ride, we headed to the China pavilion to get some nice dinner at the Nine Dragons restaurant. We had Tofu Vegetable (+ chicken) and kung pow chicken as we watched the sun set over the water. We then took a detour through the Mexican river ride before taking a couple of trips on Mission: Space. We had just enough time to walk on to the Finding Nemo ride the the Seas pavilion and then have an almost exclusive show of Turtle Talk w/ Crush. We then ran back to the World Showcase to watch Illuminations, a huge fireworks show. There were so many people, Andrea held Alyssa, Ryan stood on a railing, and Jeremy sat on my shoulders. We missed a call from Alice &amp; Al because of the noise. They had arrived late Saturday night and were staying in a Hampton Inn before they could check into their Hilton Suite on Sunday. After the show, we followed the huge crowds back to the buses, went up to our room and immediately got ready for bed and went to sleep. A very long, but fun day.</p>
<p>Sunday, January 15</p>
<p>We awoke not so early in our very small room, and tried to make a plan for the day. We decided on Hollywood Studios after consulting the Lines App. But first, we needed some breakfast. We decided to head to the Pop Century cafeteria, which was a zoo. 2880 rooms worth of guests trying to get breakfast at the same time is a little crazy. The boys both had waffles, while Andrea got a nice omelette with potatoes. We bought a couple of journals for the boys to record their own memories, and they filled them out as I ran a couple of things back to the room. We met at the bus and got to the park around noon. I immediately ran to grab Fast Passes for Star Tours, the boys' most anticipated ride, and we met at the big Grumman's Chinese Theater for the Great Movie Ride. Alyssa went on and got a little scared at the Alien part, but otherwise it was great fun. By the time we were done, out Fast Passes were good for Star Tours. Alyssa was too small for that ride, so we did a Parent Swap so the boys got to ride twice. The sequence of scenes is randomized so there are 54 different combinations of 11 scenes to see. The ending sequence on our first ride really got me as a piece of a space ship broke through our window. Looking at the map I didn't really see anything else that we either had Fast Passes left (the Toy Story Mania Fast Passes for the day were gone by 11 AM) or that we actually wanted to go on (no big roller coasters), so I grabbed another set of Star Tours fast passes. Alyssa was getting a little sleepy so Andrea took the boys on Muppet Vision 3D while we waited. We then went down past Pixar Place to look at all the people in line at Toy Story Mania and took a quick detour into a Walt Disney museum before heading to the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular. We tried to warn Alyssa about the show beforehand, but we may have overdone it as she was afraid even of the perky show hostess just talking to the crowd. Ryan and Jeremy loved it though, and I had no idea how big it was. Three huge stunt scenes on three huge sets. Then the boys and I tried to head back to Star Tours while Andrea called about some princess dresses she wanted to buy from a local. Unfortunately, around the same time the huge crowd from the car stunt show had let out, and the Fast Pass line for Star Tours was backed up more than the regular line. We decided to pass up Star Tours for the moment and head straight to the Beauty &amp; the Beast stage show. We got some great seats about a half hour before the show, and I ran out to grab some ice cream from a stand across the street while we waited. Alyssa really liked the show, but it was quite different from the Broadway version we were all familiar with. We had just enough time after the show to head back to Star Tours for one more parent swap before the park closed.</p>
