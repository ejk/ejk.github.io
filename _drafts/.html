<p>The most amazing thing Conservatives have done is somehow convince the middle-class, the struggling, the unemployed, the down-trodden of America's heartland, that giving tax cuts to income brackets far above their own and cutting social programs, many of which benefit them directly, will somehow magically put more money in their pockets. It won't. There is absolutely no direct financial gain to either strategy for the vast majority of Americans. It's brilliant.</p>
