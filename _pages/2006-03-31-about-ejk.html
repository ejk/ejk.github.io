<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>Frankly, if you're here, you probably know who I am already, let's be honest. I'm a husband to a beautiful wife, dad to two boys &amp; a beautiful baby girl, sports fan, software developer, and geek in general. I'm probably not a "hardcore" tech guru, but I hope I can share some cool techy stuff.</p>
<p>If you're interested in my experience, you can check out my (outdated) resume, but I am very happy writing software and running video game tournaments in my current employment.</p>
<p><strong>Why this site?</strong></p>
<p>This is just a place to share cool stuff that I think friends and family should know about or at least would find interesting. It's also a place to post whatever projects or pieces of code that I want to share with others.</p>
<p><strong>Why "Rhymes with Toaster"?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's a helpful reminder on how to pronounce my last name.</li>
<li>Hopefully, it's memorable.</li>
<li>It was available.</li>
</ul>
