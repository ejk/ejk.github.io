<p><strong>Disclaimer to the disclaimer:</strong></p>
<p>The disclaimer above is not my best writing... I know if I really applied myself I could do something better and funnier than just spitting out some extra words I looked up in a thesaurus.</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm trying to do this quickly.</p>
<p>Meh.</p>
