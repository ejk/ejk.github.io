  I''m doing more and more online: flickr, bloglines, moblogging, and, of course,
  drupal.


  I decided it''s about time I put a personal page together. All of my experience

  to do, plus I could easily extend it to do anything more: communicate with family

  grow a community.


  It''s stock and fresh out of the box at the moment, but I''ve got a lot of ideas

Heh.

I'm doing more and more online: [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), [bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/), moblogging, and, of course, [drupal](http://www.drupal.org/).

I decided it's about time I put a personal page together. All of my experience with drupal at work made it pretty clear that it would do everything I wanted it to do, plus I could easily extend it to do anything more: communicate with family and friends, easily share files, post and share pictures and videos, and maybe even grow a community.

It's stock and fresh out of the box at the moment, but I've got a lot of ideas to come.
