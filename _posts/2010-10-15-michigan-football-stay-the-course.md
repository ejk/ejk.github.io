[![](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/assets/2010/10/keepcalmgoblue1.jpg?w=224 "Keep Calm Go Blue"){.alignleft .size-medium .wp-image-309 width="224" height="300"}](http://rhymeswithtoaster.com/2010/10/14/keep-calm/keepcalmgoblue/)So Michigan lost to Michigan State. Denard Robinson showed that he is not perfect, and is in fact a sophomore quarterback who has only started half a dozen games. The Bandwagon is suddenly much lighter than it was a week ago when Michigan was ranked.

Yes, it'sÂ disappointing. But not unexpected.

Two years ago, the Wolverines won 3 games. Last year they won 5. This year they have already matched that total halfway through the season. They need just one more win to get to that elusive "bowl-eligible" status. In my mind, a "successful" season means 7 wins. 7 wins means Rich Rod gets at least another year to continue to work his system now that he has his players. I'd love for them to win more, but 7 in my mind is the minimum.

After Michigan went 5-0, I looked at the rest of the schedule:

Sat, Oct 9 vs \#17 Michigan State\
Sat, Oct 16 vs \#15 Iowa\
Sat, Oct 30 \@Penn State\
Sat, Nov 6 vs Illinois\
Sat, Nov 13 \@Purdue\
Sat, Nov 20 vs \#18 Wisconsin\
Sat, Nov 27 @\#1 Ohio State

To get to 7 wins, Michigan needs 2 wins out of those 7 games. Those "must win" games to me are the first two games of November: against Illinois and Purdue. If Michigan can take care of business in those two games, they will be all set. That leaves 5 games against MSU, Iowa, Penn State, Wisconsin and Ohio State-- all probable losses when you look at them individually. But if they can steal one of those five, they can get to 8 wins. If they can steal two, they can get a nice post-season showing with 9 wins.

They already failed the first of the five attempts at stealing a win. But there's still four more chances, and even if they fail those, they can get to 7 wins for a winning record and get to a bowl game.

Let's cheer on our Wolverines and root for them to rise up against these strong teams. There's a lot of football left to be played.
