It's done. A long week of cleaning and organizing has transformed a literal dumping ground of random materials into part living space, part storage, part work area in the coolest part of the house. The biggest change of the day was the moving of a desk area into the east side of the basement, near the stairway door. All three file cabinets and a large dresser with office supplies have been assembled in a mighty array of desk work goodness. The rest of that area now has rugs, toys on shelves, and an assortment of chairs. We even found a decent spot for the Thomas the Train set. The rest of the basement is now at least consolidated, if not purged. All like-typed objects are now in the same general vicinity. So, overall, this week was not a really cleaning, but a huge organizing to put ourselves in a good position.

Here's the remaining projects at this point, which will be a nice excuse to head down into the coolness of the basement as the weather warms up:

**Boxes and packing materials:**

We have sooo many boxes stacked up right now. Some night I'll have to break them all down and keep about one out of every five. If that. Also, several large bags of styrofoam peanuts.

**Clothes:**

We still have a bunch of kids' clothes in boxes that should really be gone through and organized. We all have way too many clothes.

**80's Toys:**

My son had a blast when he found my old G. I. Joes and Tranformers in the basement, but now I have the GenX first world dilemma: Do I let my son play with my first gen Optimus Prime or try to sell it on eBay?

**Papers:**

We have a TON of papers that were just thrown unto boxes and hauled into the basement to get them out of the way. I imagine that this project will take the longest to finish.

But enough of the work left to do, it's time to sit back and enjoy the space we have now. We had the whole family down there this evening playing and it felt just great. Here's the pictures showing the transformations of the week.
