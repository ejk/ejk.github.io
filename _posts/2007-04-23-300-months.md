excerpt: 'At bedtime last night, somehow the issue of 300 months came up. I wish I
  could remember how, but right now I can''t for the life of me. I think it had something
  to do with a big number and a good length of time, but the previous part of the
  conversation drifted away as I thought about it.


  I did some quick math in my head, and I told my oldest, "25 years. 300 months is
  25 years." And then I thought about it. In 25 years, I''ll be 55 years old. My oldest
  will be older than I am right now.


  What issues will he be dealing with at my age? What issues will I be dealing with?
  What will my personal and professional life look like? What kinds of technology
  will I see and use? In what kind of world will we be living in the year 2032? I
  decided to make a date with him and we would check in and see how we are doing on
  April 22, 2032.


  300 months didn''t seem like such a long time before I calculated it, but now it''s
  a third of my lifetime to look forward to.'
