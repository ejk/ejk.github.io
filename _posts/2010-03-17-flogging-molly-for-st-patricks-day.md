While dropping the kiddos off at school this morning, a particularly awesome Irish tune came on to [107.1](http://www.annarbors107one.com/) to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. I had never heard it before so I fired up [Shazam](http://www.shazam.com/) on my iPhone and it identified it as "From The Back Of A Broken Dream" by the band [Flogging Molly](http://www.floggingmolly.com/). Not only that, it found a video on youtube so I could share it with you. A nice way to start the day.
