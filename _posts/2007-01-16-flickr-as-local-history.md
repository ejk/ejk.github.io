excerpt: 'We had a magical sight outside yesterday: near freezing temperatures combined
  with a slow, steady rainfall had produced a thin layer of ice on everything. Tree
  branches, bushes, lampposts, street signs and even individual blades of grass were
  all transformed into china-shop glass treasures. Combine this with the recent warmer-than-usual
  weather and there were plenty of tree buds encased in shimmering ice. And the temperatures
  and rain continued all day, leaving plenty of opportunity to experience the sights
  all around town.


  I was able to grab a snap of a maple tree in our yard with my cameraphone and upload
  it to flickr:

  the moment. So, rather than trying to describe the scene, I could just show people
  all of the pictures on flickr. I searched for "Ann Arbor", and then using advanced

We had a magical sight outside yesterday: near freezing temperatures combined with a slow, steady rainfall had produced a thin layer of ice on *everything*. Tree branches, bushes, lampposts, street signs and even individual blades of grass were all transformed into china-shop glass treasures. Combine this with the recent warmer-than-usual weather and there were plenty of tree buds encased in shimmering ice. And the temperatures and rain continued all day, leaving plenty of opportunity to experience the sights all around town.
