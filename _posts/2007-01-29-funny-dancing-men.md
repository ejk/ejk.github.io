excerpt: 'I found this on [http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/26/stickfigure_webtoy.html|Boing
  Boing] last week, and it''s been a blast with the kids.


  [http://roxik.com/pictaps/|Pictaps] is a super-cool flash app written by Japanese
  web designer [http://roxik.com/|Masayuki Kido] that allows you to draw a character,
  then watch a multitude of them dance, cheer and jump around to the beat of funky
  music. The drawing tools are simple enough that my 6 and 3-year-olds were able to
  use them, but still sufficiently powerful to create some real artwork if you put
  some time into it.


  Another cool aspect is the semi-social features of the app. When you create a character,
  you give it a name, and it is placed into a pool of all the characters that have
  been created, along the bottom of the screen. You can click on any of these other
  characters you can see their drawing process and then see them dance around. You
  can even keep a list of favorites to watch again when you return.


  Unfortunately, there''s no way to vote for other characters or see how many have
  been favorited to see any sort of ranking of the best ones, but it''s still totally
  cool and a fun way to let the kids be creative.


  I just found that you can embed a character in your own webpage with the "Put in
  Blog" feature. It keeps getting cooler. Here''s my first creation (the embedding
  doesn''t seem to grab all of the drawing, but you get the idea):
