aka ***The Great Sorting Ceremony***

The bulk of today's effort was spent clearing some space in the back of the basement, which will be used for long-term storage. But before I can store anything there, I need to get things consolidated. So a lot of today was putting the clothes boxes with the clothes boxes, the papers with the papers, the electronics with the electronics, etc. The one real bit of progress was to get the dog crates, the rabbit hutch, a few Habitrails and the fish tanks all in the same place in the back of the room. I'm anxious to get some more things into place tomorrow. It's hard putting in so much work and not having much to show for it yet.

Nothing really to show with pictures as everything is still pretty much as crowded as before, it's just sorted. But I will show this, from a box of G.I. Joes that my son found and we had a blast playing with. It's "me" as a G.I. Joe. They had a special send-in promotion where you could order a custom figure with your own information sheet. My codename was "Tornado".
