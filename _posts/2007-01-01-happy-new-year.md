excerpt: 'Happy New Year to everyone.


  As my first post of 2007, I thought I would share a favorite video from youtube.
  This embodies everything that is good about web 2.0. It''s made by a guy in Norway
  that has either way too much time on his hands or he''s a prodigy. Either way, it''s
  an incredible demonstration of this new wave of communication, allowing worldwide
  connections. It''s great fun to watch.

  The only problem is that for every gem like this on YouTube, there are 99999 lumps
  of coal. That''s why the rating systems and popularity tracking are so important.


  Go Blue.'

Happy New Year to everyone.

As my first post of 2007, I thought I would share a favorite video from youtube. This embodies everything that is good about web 2.0. It's made by a guy in Norway that has either way too much time on his hands or he's a prodigy. Either way, it's an incredible demonstration of this new wave of communication, allowing worldwide connections. It's great fun to watch.
