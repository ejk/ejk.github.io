If by some reason you HAVEN'T yet seen the very well made and heart-wrenching campaign from Invisible Children highlighting the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, here's some responses tempering the movement with the complexities surrounding the situation.

> Is awareness good? Yes. But these problems are highly complex, not one-dimensional and, frankly, aren’t of the nature that can be solved by postering, film-making and changing your Facebook profile picture, as hard as that is to swallow. Giving your money and public support to Invisible Children so they can spend it on supporting ill-advised violent intervention and movie \#12 isn’t helping. Do I have a better answer? No, I don’t, but that doesn’t mean that you should support KONY 2012 just because it’s something.
