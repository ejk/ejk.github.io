excerpt: 'Found via [http://www.tuaw.com/2007/08/20/keeping-time-with-aurora-and-polarclock/|TUAW]:


  I just found this cool new screen saver called [http://blog.pixelbreaker.com/polarclock/|PolarClock].
  It''s a cool visualization of the current time. It''s available for Mac and Windows,
  so go get it.





  PolarClock 3.0 is now available as a screen saver for Mac and Windows, and also
  as a dashboard widget for OSX Tiger.


  This release is a total rebuild from scratch using Flash CS3, Flex Builder and ActionScript
  3.0. There has been a staggering amount of feedback over the past few months, all
  of which was very useful. There are more things to add, but there are only so many
  hours in the day!
