excerpt: 'So our mighty Pistons were unceremoniously dispatched from the NBA Playoffs
  by Dwayne Wade, Shaq, White Chocolate and the rest of the Miami Heat, leaving me
  in a familiar position: no local team in the Championship series (see Red Wings,
  Tigers, Lions, and my beloved Wolverines).


  But I''m a sports fan, right? I need to watch the championships of one of the major
  professional sports in this country, just to keep my cred as a sports geek. But
  even though I have no particular interest in either Dallas or Miami becoming the
  next champion of the NBA, I have a basic need to pick a team to root for in any
  sporting event I watch. It just makes the game more enjoyable.


  So who to pick? There are a couple of different ways to go on this:


  Pick the team that beat your team:


  I think the feeling here is that you can say your team wasn''t the best, but they
  lost to the best, so they can consider them #2, even if they aren''t in the championship.
  Sometimes I can go for this, such as one of the reasons I am currently rooting for
  the Oilers in the NHL Finals.


  I''m not sure the bruises from the Miami beat-down of Detroit have healed enough
  for this to work.


  Pick the underdog:


  I always like the underdog rising up and creating a good upset. Perhaps a bit of
  schadenfreude when I think about it, but great upsets are some of the best games
  in sports history: Super Bowl III, and the Miracle on Ice to name a few. This is
  another reason to root for the Oilers (a #8 seed) in the NHL finals.


  But does that apply here? The Heat were the #2 seed, and Dallas was a strong #4
  seed (second only to the #1 team in their division). So no obvious underdog here.


  Strong Like/Dislike:


  Sometimes you just get a feeling about a player or a team. Or you have a grudge
  because of team history. For me, as a Red Wing fan I''ll never root for the Avalanche.
  As a Michigan fan, I''ll never root for Notre Dame. And I just don''t like the Miami
  Hurricanes. No good reason. Just don''t like ''em.


  Dallas? No strong feeling. Miami? Well... No real hatred, but there''s a definite
  leaning to partial dislike there. But that''s not enough. I need...


  The X Factor:


  This man is the reason I''m rooting for the Mavs:




  Mark Cuban owns the Dallas Mavericks. Mark Cuban is a geek. He should be the hero
  of every self-professed sports geek in the world. This man started up a streaming
  audio service in his bathroom with a single HP server and an ISDN line and transformed
  it into Broadcast.com, which he sold to Yahoo for over 5 Billion dollars. Yes, that''s
  Billion with a ''B''. And he started it to be able to personally listen to basketball
  games. He has a blog. He puts his email address on the jumbotron for fans to contact
  him. He''s still involved with current geekery such as HDTV technologies. He speaks
  his mind, has a sense of humor, and knows more about hardcore technology than I
  ever will. Mark Cuban is the sports geek''s dream. And that''s why I''m rooting
  for the Dallas Mavericks.'
