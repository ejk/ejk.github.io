  about to sink into the depths of black backgrounds, glittery animated gifs, and
  autoloading emo music. (I''d link to some examples, but considering 99.99% of MySpace
  pages are perfect examples of this, I''ll let the reader explore for themselves.)


  I have always been a little weary of MySpace-- every time I had stumbled into it
  I was immediately put off by the sheer ugliness of it. It was like I had stepped
  into a time warp back to 1996. Blinking text, animated images, black backgrounds,
  COMIC SANS MS... But you have to admit they must be doing something right to have
  millions of members. The pure volume of people in a social network like that is
  worth tapping into. My employer agrees, and as an outreach project, the [http://www.aadl.org|AADL]
  is in the process of creating a MySpace page. When asked, I happily joined up to
  help with some of the technical details.


  The first order of business was to find a decent layout. There are tons of third-party
  sites devoted to crappy cut and paste layouts for your MySpace, with some diamonds
  in the rough. But still they didn''t look very clean or professional. Then, by luck
  or fate, I found [http://www.mikeindustries.com/|Mike Davidson''s] blog post, [http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts|Hacking
  A More Tasteful MySpace]. This is what I was looking for! Mike had carefully and
  painstakingly dissected the mishmash of HTML elements on a MySpace profile page
  and was able to constuct CSS rules to tame them. Thank goodness. In order to try
  them out, and because of the social networking aspect of it, I created [http://www.myspace.com/ejkook|my
  own MySpace page] and tested out Mike''s brilliant work. It still needs a little
  tweaking, but I think it''s safe to say it''s already looking better than most.


  I filled out some info and did a quick search and found a good friend of mine who
  used to live next door to me. We lost touch after high school and it''s great to
  touch base with him. I''ve already found some other folks from my past that I need
  to contact. Plus, it''s another place to let people find my flickr stream and this
  blog. MySpace is not all bad so far.


  In contrast, on the same day that I created my MySpace account, I was serendipitously  invited
  by [http://www.blyberg.net|John] to join [http://www.linkedin.com|LinkedIn] a social
  networking site for professionals. I had read about it a little from [http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/|Ed
  Vielmetti]. You create a profile with your professional experience, and you can
  make connections to the profiles of former and existing coworkers, friends, and
  family. They have millions of users at this point (though not quite the numbers
  that MySpace has). The key is the chaining of connections from 2 and 3 degrees away
  from your own. They make it easy to get your connections to introduce you to their
  connections, who then you can add to your connections, building your professional
  network online. Oh, and the site is has a clean, useful design, and everybody''s
  profile looks exactly as good as everyone else''s. It''s a cool idea, and I think
  it''ll be tons more beneficial than MySpace in the long run.
