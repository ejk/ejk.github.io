I've gotten back into DDR (StepMania) in the last week or two, and we pulled out the pads last night with the boys after dinner. I created a couple of new profiles for them and let them go at it. They had a lot of fun.

Even though they aren't going to win any competitions any time soon, we are already well along the path of training the next generation to seize control.
