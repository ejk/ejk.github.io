Not only is this a interesting look into one of Disney's earliest rides, it taught me that the auditory cortex is the part of the brain where earworms get stuck.

The song is a common "earworm," a piece of music that can easily get lodged in the auditory cortex, the part of the brain that retains audio information, [identified](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/04/050425202958.htm) by researchers at Dartmouth College in 2005.
