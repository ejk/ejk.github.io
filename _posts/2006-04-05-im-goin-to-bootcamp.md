excerpt: 'Apple today announced BootCamp, an Apple-created utility for dual booting
  your (and my) intel iMac with OS X and Windows XP. This is certainly more appealing
  than the OnMac method, which admirably came first.


  "Boot Camp lets you install Windows XP without moving your Mac data, though you
  will need to bring your own copy to the table, as Apple Computer does not sell or
  support Microsoft Windows.(1) Boot Camp will burn a CD of all the required drivers
  for Windows so you don''t have to scrounge around the Internet looking for them."


  If that means native graphics drivers, bring it on. Let''s see how Battlefield 2
  runs on this baby.


  Update:


  We''re up and running, and BF2 indeed runs smooth as silk at 1280 x 960. It''s great
  to have native drivers for all the hardware. Read More for some camera phone pics
  from the install process:'

The strange thing is-- I haven't booted into XP since.
