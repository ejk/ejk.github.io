excerpt: 'I''ve had a few thoughts recently that don''t merit a full blog post, but
  I still want to share. Perhaps a [http://tumblr.com|tumblelog] might be better for
  me to share quick ideas and thoughts. Anyhoo, here''s a few ideas that have popped
  into my head recently:



  What the heck is [http://www.demko.com/AARP070630.htm|that thing on Kevin Costner''s
  face]?

  There''s always that moment when you realize, "oh yeah, I did have asparagus at
  dinner." Those of you who eat asparagus know what I mean. Gets me every time.

  Thank goodness for air conditioning at work.

  My kid is turning into a total pokemanic, but at least it''s better than captain
  underpants quotes all the time. Heck, I''m starting to like playing pokemon myself.
