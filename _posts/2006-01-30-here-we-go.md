  one of these babies:




  Yep, we''re taking the plunge: a 20" intel imac. And even a larger upgrade than
  one might think considering The Wife(tm) has been working on a G3 tower running
  MacOS 8.6 for the last 7(!) years. We decided to go with the 20 instead of the 17
  because this machine should become her new video editing station with the latest
  version of Final Cut Studio (once the Universal Binary version is released) instead
  of Final Cut Pro 1(!) which she has been using.


  We also decided to get the Applecare 3 year extended warranty. There''s no telling
  what can happen with first generation hardware.'

Yep, we're taking the plunge: a 20" intel imac. And even a larger upgrade than one might think considering The Wife(tm) has been working on a G3 tower running MacOS 8.6 for the last 7(!) years. We decided to go with the 20 instead of the 17 because this machine should become her new video editing station with the latest version of Final Cut Studio (once the Universal Binary version is released) instead of Final Cut Pro 1(!) which she has been using.
