excerpt: 'Just a quick update this week. I had a good talk yesterday with the [http://www.stayathomegeek.com/|Stay-at-Home-Geek,
  Duane Collicott] about his upcoming celebration of all things lego, [http://www.brickbash.com/|Brick
  Bash].


  We''ve brought the kids the last two years and it''s been great. Duane''s invited
  a lot of cool exhibitors and has plenty to look and play with, from trains to spaceships
  to awesomely complex robots. Duane''s working on a cool raffle prize as well.


  It''s in a new location this year, as the popularity has outgrown the previous location.
  It''ll now be held at the Ann Arbor Academy on South Main Street downtown, formerly
  the Neutral Zone, formerly the Ark, on Saturday March 24, from 11 AM to 6 PM.
