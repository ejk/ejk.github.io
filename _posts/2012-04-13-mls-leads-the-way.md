> In addition, MLS has given up on relying on the better angels of players’ nature to stop the diving and simulation American audiences so abhor. If a player tumbles to the ground without contact or feigns injury without being touched, he’ll be forced to write a check. If that action results in a goal or card that shows up in the box score, a suspension is likely as well.

Major League Soccer in the United States is taking a hard stance on diving. This is wonderful.
