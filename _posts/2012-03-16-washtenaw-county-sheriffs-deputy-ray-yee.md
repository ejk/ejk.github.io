From last night's tornado in Dexter, Michigan, this amazing tidbit buried in a AnnArbor.com story.

> Washtenaw County Sheriff's Deputy Ray Yee was the first officer on the scene in Dexter.
>
> Yee approached one destroyed home Thursday, and **saw a hand sticking out of the rubble. He pulled out an elderly man, who was shaken but walked away.**
>
> "That's the best part," Yee said. "Every place I went to, I would have thought I would have found somebody laying there â€” deceased or whatever. But, knock on wood, everybody was OK."

Great to see the community coming together and the cleanup starting in earnest so quickly.
