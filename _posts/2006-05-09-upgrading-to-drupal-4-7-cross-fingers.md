  UPDATE:


  Well, I''ve made the update, and so far it''s working just fine. The first thing

  from a list to a string of comma separated values. I''m free to tag away!


  Now, I need to get my theme and some modules up and running again.'

The Freetagging capabilities in Drupal 4.7 alone make it worth the upgrade.

Luckily I found this great video tutorial to guide me:

I just need to backup first, then we'll see what happens.

UPDATE:

Well, I've made the update, and so far it's working just fine. The first thing I did was to go in and change my "tags" taxonomy to use the freetagging option. On little click, and all my current tags were magically transformed from selections from a list to a string of comma separated values. I'm free to tag away!
